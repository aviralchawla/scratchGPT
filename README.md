# scratchGPT

I'm excited to share this project, `scratchGPT`.

I wrote this Python notebook to show how surprisingly straightforward it can be to build a GPT model from the ground up. My goal was to pull back the curtain and expose the guts of the model, showing how it all works in a simple, step-by-step way.

A huge shout-out and inspiration for this project goes to Andrej Karpathy and his amazing tutorials on building neural networks. If you haven't checked them out, you should!

In the future, I hope to expand on this work and create even better tutorials, specifically for researchers in the social sciences and humanities who want to understand and use these models in their own work.
